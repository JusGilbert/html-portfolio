<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Jayeion and I'm a front-end developer from Arizona. I started my professional career in journalism
  Belive it or not but made the switch to front-end development after years of hacking away at codeing through codeacademy
and other websites. </p>

<p>I'm actullay happy that you took the time to visit my site and check out all the work I've done from the very beginning
  of my coding career until now. Here you will see my actual frist project to something I just did this month.</p>

<p>Feel free to check out the rest of my page and contact me if you want something made or edited! No job is too small
  and honestly I'm just happy to help. Cheers.</p>
